<h1>Warehouse Managment System (WMS) </h1>

<h2> <em> Main goal </em></h2> 

<p> The goal of this project is to create a fully functional prototype web application for a <strong> Warehouse Management System </strong> (<em>"a software application designed to support and optimize warehouse functionality and distribution center management"</em>). This website will help to keep track of where the stock of the company is and will also let the users of the system move the stock around by placing orders. It will keep track of every item, their quantity and location, who ordered which item and so on. 
</p>
<p> Additionally, i will learn how to create a custom dynamic web application that stores the information in a database, has a user system and let's registered users interact with the contents of the database with web forms, making persistent changes on the website content.
</p>

<p> Further, i will be given small incremental goals that i can reach with the knowledge acquired at every step of the learning experience, ending up with a complete road map that will guide me on my way to completing my first web application.</p>
